# Results

> All results here are generated using the fpgaconvnet tools from the parent folder, as well as Vivado 2019.1

This folder contains all the results and artefacts relating to our paper.
Each folder within has a hardware configuration file generated by the [optimiser](https://github.com/AlexMontgomerie/fpgaconvnet-optimiser), as well as the generated hardware information.
The title of each folder within the directory is of the structure `{model}-{spatial dim}-{fpga}`.

The file structure is as follows:

```
├── config.json
├── report.json
└── rsc/
    ├── power.rpt
    ├── resource_report.csv
    └── timing_report_full.csv
```

- `config.json`: the hardware configuration file generated by the optimiser
- `report.json`: estimated resources and performance from [fpgaconvnet-model](https://github.com/AlexMontgomerie/fpgaconvnet-model)
- `power.rpt`: power estimation report generated by vivado for the generated hardware
- `resource_report.csv`: resource report generated by vivado for the generated hardware
- `timing_report_full.csv`: timing report generated by vivado for the generated hardware
